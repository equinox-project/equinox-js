# MessageDB

MessageDB is a fully-featured event store and message store implemented in PostgreSQL for Pub/Sub, Event Sourcing,
Messaging, and Evented Microservices applications. It was extracted from
the [Eventide Project](http://docs.eventide-project.org/) to make it easier for users to write clients in the language
of their choosing.
