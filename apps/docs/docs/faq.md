# Why name it Equinox?

The original [jet/equinox](https://github.com/jet/equinox) is named after the DC
superhero of the same name. The authors of EquinoxJS were not aware of this. Our
reasons for the Equinox name are:

1. An equinox is a significant *event* in most cultures
2. It is inherently intertwined with the concept of time
3. It represents synchronisation and balance
