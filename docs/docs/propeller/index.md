# Propeller

Propeller is EquinoxJS's "[propulsion](https://github.com/jet/propulsion)
lite". It's a set of components for building reactive event processing
pipelines catering specifically for event sourced reactions from Equinox's
stores. In most cases equinox users will not interact directly with propeller.
Instead each store exposes a `Source` that is implemented in terms of propeller
components.
